# SMARS Manual: Resources and Buildings

## Resource Types in SMARS:

NOTE: Resources and Buildings with an Asterisk are not to be included in the version 1.0 release, since they add too much complexity.

### Raw Materials (mined from the Martian surface):

    - Rock          (Representing simple minerals like those comprising most rocks on Earth)
    - Sand          (Representing the famous 'red sands' of Mars; made of silicon, oxygen and iron)
    - Ice           (Representing the frozen waters of Mars; mostly found in deep craters or the poles)
    * Organic Waste (Representing the colonists' own... leavings; must be recycled into fresh food!)
    * Volatiles     (Representing the rarer elements in the Martian crust like calcium, chlorine, sulfur, etc.)

### Renewable Resources (produced with no cost with the appropriate infrastructure):

    - Power (an initial supply exists at the start, and more can be made in various ways)
    - CO2 (extracted from the atmosphere to make various organic compounds)
    - Air (an initial supply exists at the start, and more can be made in various ways)

### Refined Materials (produced from the Raw materials):

    - Metal (made from rock)
    - Glass (made from sand)
    * Water (made from ice)
    * Chemicals (made from volatiles)

### Colony Consumables (required to sustain the colonists' physical needs)

    - Food
    - Air

### Intangible Commodities (non-resource indicators of the colonists' wellness)

    - Health
    - Morale

## Buildings in SMARS:

### Rudimentary Buildings (Built with 'raw materials' only):

    - Glass Factory (Built with rock; uses sand and power to make glass)
    - Metal Smelter (Built with rock and sand; uses rock and power to make metal)

### Basic Buildings (Built with at least some 'refined materials'):

    - Solar Panels (Built with metal and glass; produces power with no inputs)
    - CO2 Collector (Built with rock and glass; uses power to produce CO2)
    - Oxygen Separator (Built with rock, metal and glass; uses rock and power to produce air)
    - Greenhouse (Built with metal, glass and ice; uses CO2 and power to produce food and air)

### Advanced Buildings (Built from 'refined materials' for non-economic purposes; needed to win the game??):

    - Habitation Dome (Built with metal, glass and air; uses air and power to add + 1 to colony health and morale; required for victory)
    - Radio Tower (Built with rock, metal and glass; uses power to send a signal to Earth; required for victory)
    * Hospital (Built with metal, glass and ice; uses power to add + 1 to colony health)
