# Welcome to Project P5JS AKA Da Game Jamm

## Game Prototype 0: The sidescrolling resource-management survival game!

This game aims to be an extremely crude prototype for the up-and-coming Mars Colony simulator game that I hope to someday build. Will P5JS prove itself worthy of further use? Is this the future of web-based gaming? Can the player collect enough resources to survive until they are rescued? Only time will tell!

## Dev Notes

### Phase 0 - November 3, 2021

1. Installed P5JS extension and related libraries and re-familiarized myself with the Live server.

2. Watched some tutorials and checked out a demo project (eerily similar to Blockland, I was vaguely pleased to see).

3. Created very simple demo of a bar that shrinks but when you click the mouse it gets bigger again. This is the entire game in a nutshell.

### Phase 1 - Initial Classes and Key Inputs - November 5, 2021

1. Create block object class with render method that creates a square (with one of three colors depending on the block's type).

2. Create map object class with render method that will be called in the sketch's draw function.

3. Create player object class, which is a little rover that can be moved from side to side with the A and S keys.

4. Create Constants file for top-level game parameters.

### Phase 2 - Mouse Click Handlers and Better Maps - November 6, 2021
