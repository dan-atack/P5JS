# Welcome to Project P5JS AKA Da Game Jamm

## Game Prototype 0: The sidescrolling resource-management survival game!

This game aims to be an extremely crude prototype for the up-and-coming Mars Colony simulator game that I hope to someday build. Will P5JS prove itself worthy of further use? Is this the future of web-based gaming? Can the player collect enough resources to survive until they are rescued? Only time will tell!

## Dev Notes

### November 3, 2021

1. Installed P5JS extension and related libraries and re-familiarized myself with the Live server.

2. Watched some tutorials and checked out a demo project (eerily similar to Blockland, I was vaguely pleased to see).

3. Created very simple demo of a bar that shrinks but when you click the mouse it gets bigger again. This is the entire game in a nutshell.
